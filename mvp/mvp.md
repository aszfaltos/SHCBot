# Minimal viable product

#### Selecting user stories

The easiest and fastest deployable product is a basic information retrieval
system. With this we can almost cover **Oliver Gray**'s usecases in it's entirety
and cover the basics needed by the two other **user personas**.
However **Sarah Jones** and **Jeffrey Carter** would need more rule based and
specialized solutions integrated into our system for optimal and accurate
performance on finential information about scholarships and other opportunities.

#### MVP

The main user story we want to satisfy (**Oliver Gray**) requires easy access to
university provided information, such as phone numbers and email adresses of 
administrators, policy and regulation documents, and descriptions and guides of
processes from the university website. Oliver also needs an easy and fast way to search through this 
information, even from hes phone.

We can satisfy these needs by collecting all available university materials from
the web in one place, and make them searchable. For the ease of use, human friendly
searching experience, and mobile friendly UI we can also provide a chat interface
where the user can talk to the chatbot about the required information, and the
assistant would optimally search in the collected documents and link the results
of the search, but also summarize the information into a short answer to the user
question.

Requirements:
- Chat feature for human friendly interface
- Only answering with accurate information
- Access to up to date information about ELTE
- Providing sources to provided information

Our **MVP** would basically be a specialized search engine on all the ELTE
recources, that has a chat interface to make it easier for the user to tell
the system what they need.
