Google Search:

Google is a dominant information retrieval tool, offering access to vast online resources. However, the challenge lies in filtering through an overwhelming amount of data, much of which may be outdated, misleading, or irrelevant. Academic inquiries often require extensive research and source validation, making Google an inefficient tool for quick, reliable answers. By contrast, our chatbot streamlines the process by delivering direct, accurate, and institution-specific responses without requiring students to navigate multiple sources.


ChatGPT:

ChatGPT is a widely used large language model (LLM) capable of generating responses based on extensive training data. However, its broad knowledge base presents several limitations. The model may mix similar information, fail to provide precise academic guidance, or reference outdated or unreliable data. Additionally, because it is not specifically tailored to a university setting, it may not address institution-specific inquiries accurately. Our chatbot will be trained exclusively on verified and relevant academic resources, ensuring students receive precise and contextually appropriate answers.


University Staff & Faculty:

While students can seek guidance from university staff and faculty, this approach has limitations. Professors and administrative personnel often manage heavy workloads, leading to delayed responses to student inquiries. Furthermore, some issues may require immediate assistance, making email communication impractical for time-sensitive matters. Our chatbot serves as an efficient alternative, providing instant support while reducing the administrative burden on university personnel.
