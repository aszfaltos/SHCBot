# Value Proposition

Our customers are mostly university students, who want to find information about the university, studies or scholarships fast. This however, can be really tedious. Usually a user would make a google search, which would result in a lot of unrelated answers, or even information about different institutions which can be missleading if someone is not careful. 

The university also has websites containing a lot of information, and they have search functions too, however they are working on a keyword basis, so if a user misspells something, or doesn't know the exact terms they are searching for these would be ineffective. On top of this there is not one central website where every single piece of information is available.

Students can also ask existing AI based chat services, but since they are general purpose they lack neceserry insight into the rules and structures of the university.

The university also provides staff members who can help students with finding out information, however their time is limited, and ELTE itself recommends searching online before asking someone for help.

Our solution would solve these issues since the AI would provide a human interface that is easy to use and communicate with, it would be up 24/7 since it is not human, and it would have access to all university resources through a database, this way it will be able to provide accurate information about any topic regarding the university.

These are the reasons why we think an AI powered chatbot, that is specifically tailored to the students needs would be of great value to the ELTE community.
