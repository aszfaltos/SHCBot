# Minimal viable product

#### Selecting user stories

The easiest and fastest deployable product is a basic information retrieval
system. With this we can cover **Oliver Gray**'s user story in it's entirety
and cover the basics needed by the two other **user personas**.
However **Sarah Jones** and **Jeffrey Carter** would need more rule based and
specialized solutions integrated into our system for optimal and accurate
performance on finential information about scholarships and other opportunities.

#### MVP

Requirements:
- Chat feature for human friendly interface
- Only answering with accurate information
- Access to up to date information about ELTE
- Providing sources to provided information

Our **MVP** would basically be a specialized search engine on all the ELTE
recources, that has a chat interface to make it easier for the user to tell
the system what they need.
