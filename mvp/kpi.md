# KPI

#### Considerations

Our product is not a commercial one, it is service that the University can
provide its students. This means we don't have or shouldn't have real revenue
potential, thus we need to define a **KPI** in a different way.


#### Defining a KPI

Our most important metric is user satisfaction, thus we should have a **KPI**
correlating to this. In chat systems it is an industry standard to have users
rate the answers of the assistant. This can be eather a like dislike button
or even a more complex questionair, however the later would be cumbersome for
users. We need the most straight forward way to rate responses.

According to the above reasoning we should allow users to rate each response
of the assistant in a binary (satisfactory, not satisfactory) way. Later we
can aggregate the collected data into a simple **Satisfaction Rate (SR)**, the
percentage of positive responses.

#### Defining the target

A good target would be an **80% SR**, however for accurate assessment we would
need a large enough sample size. It would be feasable to get 100 rated
responses in the duration of user testing.
